## üåü Features

- **Real-Time Notifications:** Get instant alerts on Telegram the moment a seat becomes available.
- **Multi-User Support:** Any user can interact with the bot to track courses.
- **Multi-Course Tracking:** Track multiple course sections simultaneously.
- **Resilient & Automated:** A GitHub Actions-powered scraper runs every few minutes, ensuring reliable and continuous monitoring.
- **Easy to Use:** Simple, command-based interaction directly within Telegram.

## ü§ñ How It Works

This project is built on a decoupled, serverless architecture, ensuring scalability and reliability.

1.  **The Telegram Bot (The Frontend):** A Python script (`bot.py`) runs 24/7 on a cloud host (e.g., Render). It listens for user commands like `/track` and `/untrack`.
2.  **The Database (The Brain):** When a user requests to track a course, the bot saves this request (user's chat ID, department, and CRN) to a central **Supabase** (PostgreSQL) database.
3.  **The Scraper (The Worker):** A GitHub Actions workflow (`scheduler.yml`) triggers the main scraping script (`course_offering.py`) on a regular schedule (e.g., every 5 minutes).
4.  **The Logic:** The scraper connects to the Supabase database to get the full list of all courses being tracked. It then makes an efficient, single API call per department to KFUPM's course offering API to check for seat availability.
5.  **The Notification:** If an open spot is found, the scraper queries the database to find all users tracking that specific course and sends a personalized notification to each one via the Telegram Bot API. The tracking request is then removed to prevent spam.

-   `/track <DEPT> <CRN>` - Start tracking a specific course section.
    -   *Example:* `/track ICS 202`
-   `/untrack <DEPT> <CRN>` - Stop tracking a course section.
